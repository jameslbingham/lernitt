      <h1>Lernitt Complaints Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Effective Date: 10/12/2025</strong></p>

      <p>
        Lernitt Pty Ltd (“Lernitt”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) is committed to providing a fair, 
        safe and reliable platform for students and tutors. This Complaints Policy explains 
        how you may submit a complaint, how we handle complaints, and what outcomes you may expect.
      </p>

      <p>
        This Policy operates alongside the Terms and Conditions, the Privacy Policy, and other 
        platform policies. Where a complaint concerns a matter already addressed in the Terms 
        (such as lesson disputes or account breaches), this Policy supports and does not 
        override those Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>1) Purpose of This Policy</h2>
      <p>a) To provide a clear and fair process for raising concerns about tutors, students, content, conduct, safety or platform performance.</p>
      <p>b) To describe how Lernitt receives, assesses, investigates and resolves complaints.</p>
      <p>c) To support transparency and good practice in accordance with Australian consumer standards.</p>
      <p>d) To complement, but not replace, the dispute-resolution procedures in the Terms & Conditions.</p>

      <h2>2) What Is a Complaint?</h2>
      <p>A complaint is any expression of dissatisfaction relating to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A tutor’s or student’s behaviour, professionalism, communication or conduct.</li>
        <li>Lesson quality, teaching methods, safety issues or inappropriate content.</li>
        <li>Platform functionality or technical issues affecting lessons.</li>
        <li>Potential breaches of Lernitt policies, including Terms, Privacy, Community Conduct, AML/CTF.</li>
        <li>Payment concerns not covered by normal lesson dispute processes.</li>
        <li>Concerns about fairness, accessibility or customer service.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Note: Lesson cancellations, refunds and contractual disputes follow Sections 25–26 of the 
        Terms. This Policy supports that process but does not replace it.
      </p>

      <h2>3) Who May Make a Complaint?</h2>
      <p>a) Any registered student or tutor.</p>
      <p>b) Parents/guardians of minors using Lernitt.</p>
      <p>c) Individuals affected by behaviour occurring on the platform.</p>
      <p>d) Law enforcement or regulatory bodies.</p>
      <p>Anonymous complaints may be reviewed but may limit investigation outcomes.</p>
