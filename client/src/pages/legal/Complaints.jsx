      <h1>Lernitt Complaints Policy</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Effective Date:</strong> 10/12/2025
      </p>

      <p>
        Lernitt Pty Ltd (&quot;Lernitt&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot;, or
        &quot;our&quot;) is committed to providing a fair, safe and reliable
        platform for students and tutors. This Complaints Policy explains how
        you may submit a complaint, how we handle complaints, and what outcomes
        you may expect.
      </p>

      <p>
        This Policy operates alongside the Terms and Conditions, the Privacy
        Policy, and other platform policies. Where a complaint concerns a
        matter already addressed in the Terms (such as lesson disputes or
        account breaches), this Policy supports and does not override those
        Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>1) Purpose of This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>a)</strong> To provide a clear and fair process for raising
        concerns about tutors, students, content, conduct, safety or platform
        performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>b)</strong> To describe how Lernitt receives, assesses,
        investigates and resolves complaints.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>c)</strong> To support transparency and good practice in
        accordance with Australian consumer standards and platform governance
        expectations.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>d)</strong> To complement, but not replace, the dispute and
        conflict-resolution procedures set out in the Terms &amp; Conditions.
      </p>

      <h2>2) What Is a Complaint?</h2>
      <p>A complaint is any expression of dissatisfaction relating to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          a tutor&apos;s or student&apos;s behaviour, professionalism,
          communication or conduct.
        </li>
        <li>lesson quality, teaching methods, safety issues or content.</li>
        <li>platform functionality or technical issues affecting lessons.</li>
        <li>
          potential breaches of Lernitt policies, including Terms &amp;
          Conditions, Privacy, Community Conduct, or AML/CTF requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
          payment concerns not already handled through the lesson dispute
          process (e.g., suspected fraud, account misuse).
        </li>
        <li>
          concerns about fairness, accessibility or customer service
          interactions.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note: Lesson cancellations, refunds and contractual disputes between
        tutors and students continue to follow the dispute procedures in
        Sections 25–26 of the Terms. This Policy supports that process but does
        not replace it.
      </p>

      <h2>3) Who May Make a Complaint?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Any registered student or tutor.</li>
        <li>Parents/guardians of minors using Lernitt.</li>
        <li>Individuals affected by behaviour occurring on the platform.</li>
        <li>Law enforcement or regulatory bodies (where applicable).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Anonymous complaints may be reviewed but may limit our ability to
        resolve the matter.
      </p>

      <h2>5) How We Handle Complaints</h2>
      <p>
        Lernitt follows a structured process to ensure fairness and consistency:
      </p>

      <h3>a) Acknowledgement</h3>
      <p>
        We will acknowledge receipt of your complaint within a reasonable
        period.
      </p>

      <h3>b) Assessment</h3>
      <p>We determine whether the complaint:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>falls under this Complaints Policy</li>
        <li>falls under the dispute procedures in the Terms</li>
        <li>requires immediate safety action</li>
        <li>
          needs referral to a specialist team (e.g., payments, AML/CTF, safety,
          technical)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>c) Investigation</h3>
      <p>We may:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>review lesson records and logs</li>
        <li>examine chat messages and booking details</li>
        <li>request information from the tutor or student involved</li>
        <li>check compliance with platform rules</li>
        <li>
          review recordings (where permitted under policy and law, and where
          available)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>d) Temporary Measures</h3>
      <p>Where necessary, we may take interim action:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>temporarily restrict features</li>
        <li>pause payouts</li>
        <li>suspend accounts pending investigation</li>
        <li>block suspicious transactions</li>
        <li>remove unsafe or inappropriate content</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>e) Resolution</h3>
      <p>
        Once the investigation is complete, we will provide one of the following
        outcomes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>complaint upheld (with corrective action)</li>
        <li>complaint partially upheld</li>
        <li>complaint not upheld</li>
        <li>no conclusion possible (evidence insufficient)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Corrective actions may include warning notices, account restrictions,
        refunds (where authorised by Terms), content removal, or permanent
        suspension.
      </p>

      <h2>6) Timeframes for Resolution</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Simple issues: typically within 5–10 business days.</li>
        <li>
          More complex issues (e.g., safety concerns, fraud, AML reviews): up to
          25 business days.
        </li>
        <li>
          Regulatory or legal matters may take longer as required by law.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We aim to resolve complaints promptly but cannot guarantee fixed
        timelines.
      </p>

      <h2>7) Outcomes You May Expect</h2>
      <p>Depending on the nature of the complaint, outcomes may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>clarification of platform rules</li>
        <li>correction of technical issues</li>
        <li>a formal apology</li>

      </ul>
      <p>
        Lernitt&apos;s decisions regarding platform conduct, policy breaches and
        account management are final, consistent with the Terms &amp;
        Conditions.
      </p>

      <h2>8) When a Complaint Will Not Be Upheld</h2>
      <p>A complaint may not be upheld if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>it lacks sufficient detail or evidence.</li>
        <li>
          it relates to matters explicitly governed by the Terms (e.g., expired
          requests, contract-based lesson disputes) where rules have been
          correctly applied.
        </li>
        <li>
          the issue falls outside Lernitt&apos;s responsibility (e.g., internet
          outages, user hardware problems).
        </li>
        <li>
          the complaint concerns subjective teaching preferences that do not
          violate policy.
        </li>
        <li>the complaint is vexatious, abusive, or made in bad faith.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>9) Escalation and Appeals</h2>
      <p>If you are dissatisfied with the outcome:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>a)</strong> You may request a review by a senior member of the
          Lernitt team.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>b)</strong> Lernitt may ask for additional information before
          reconsidering.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>c)</strong> Appeals must be submitted within 10 business days
          of receiving the decision.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>d)</strong> If the matter meets criteria under Section 26 of
          the Terms (Conflict Settlement Procedure), it will follow the dispute
          settlement process outlined in the Terms.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>e)</strong> External statutory bodies (e.g., Australian
          consumer regulators) may also be contacted where applicable.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>10) Safety, Misconduct and Urgent Issues</h2>
      <p>The following are prioritised immediately:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>harassment, bullying or abuse</li>
        <li>threats, self-harm or criminal behaviour</li>
