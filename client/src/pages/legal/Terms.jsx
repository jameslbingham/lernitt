1) General
a) By using our website or app, you confirm that you’ve read and understand these Terms and Conditions.
b) Once you complete registration, you become a member and agree to follow these Terms and Conditions.
c) By using our website, app or any of our services, you agree to follow these Terms—whether or not you’ve registered an account.
d) These Terms form a legal agreement between you and Lernitt covering your use of our website, app, services and all related content.
e) If you don’t agree with these Terms, please don’t access, register for, or use the website, app or services.
f) If you break these Terms, we may suspend or close your account. Serious breaches could also lead to civil or criminal penalties under the law.
g) You understand that Lernitt only provides a platform. We’re not part of any agreement between a student and a tutor, and we don’t control how users behave or what happens during lessons.
h) Tutors use Lernitt as independent contractors, not as employees, partners or agents of Lernitt. You’re responsible for your own taxes, insurance, business licences and legal obligations in your country.
i) Tutors must not claim or suggest that they’re employed by, officially approved by, or representing Lernitt, unless we’ve given written permission.
j) By using our website or app, you agree to everything in these Terms. If you don’t agree, you can’t use Lernitt.
k) If you’re using Lernitt on behalf of a company or organisation, you confirm that you have the authority to bind it to these Terms.
l) Lernitt’s role is limited to providing the online platform and tools that help students and tutors connect, schedule lessons and handle payments. We don’t provide tutoring ourselves and aren’t responsible for lesson content, timing, quality or results.
m) These Terms are governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Victoria. You agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Victoria, Australia.

2) Our Service
a) The main purpose of this website is to provide a platform that helps students and tutors find and connect with each other for lessons.
b) The goal of this service is to support one-on-one online learning between students who want to learn and tutors who wish to teach.
c) Students can view tutor profiles, read their descriptions, and choose a tutor based on this information. Students decide which tutor they believe best fits their learning needs.
d) Either a tutor or a student may stop using our website or app at any time.
e) Lernitt does not guarantee that a student or tutor will find a match, book a lesson, or complete a transaction. All users participate at their own risk.

3) How Our Website, App and Services Work
The Site and App provide a space where:
a) Tutors and students can upload information about their lessons and profiles.
b) Tutors and students can search for, contact, and connect with each other for learning purposes.
c) Students can contact tutors directly to arrange lessons.
d) Tutors can advertise their services, respond to messages, and arrange lessons directly with students.
e) Lernitt only provides the technology platform that allows tutors and students to find and contract with each other.
f) Lernitt also provides basic tools for communication, scheduling, payment processing, and limited dispute assistance. These tools are provided as a convenience and do not make Lernitt a party to any agreement between students and tutors.

4) What We Do for Students and Tutors
a) We make our website and app available so that students and tutors can find and connect with each other. We are not involved in their lesson agreements or teaching activities. We do not control or guarantee the quality, accuracy, safety, legality, or completion of any lesson.
b) Once the tutor’s availability, price and service are accepted by both the tutor and the student, a “Lesson Contract” is formed between them.
c) Lesson Contracts are private agreements between the student and tutor. You must not add terms that conflict with these Terms and Conditions or with Australian law.
d) Both tutors and students agree to act in good faith and fairness when performing their Lesson Contract.
e) Lernitt may take actions such as suspending accounts, removing listings, or pursuing legal steps if we believe it necessary to protect our users, business, or reputation.

5) General Terms for Tutors and Students
a) Our Services are available only to individuals or legal entities who can enter binding contracts under Australian law. You must accept these Terms before registering. Lernitt may, at its discretion, refuse, suspend, or terminate service to anyone.
b) Each tutor and student is responsible for keeping their personal information (including email addresses) accurate and up to date. By agreeing to these Terms, you release Lernitt from all claims or damages that may arise from inaccurate or outdated personal information.
c) We may suspend or terminate any tutor or student account for breaching these Terms. In such cases, no refunds or compensation will be provided.
d) Tutors and students are solely responsible for the accuracy and legality of the information they publish on Lernitt, including lesson descriptions, qualifications and pricing.

6) Enforcement of Terms and Conditions
a) We may suspend or cancel your account if you breach these Terms or act in a way that could harm Lernitt or other users.
b) Lernitt may suspend or terminate your account if we cannot verify your details, if we suspect misconduct, or if your actions may cause legal risk to Lernitt or others.
c) If your account is suspended or terminated, you must not create or use another account. We may also take legal action if necessary.
d) We may terminate any account at any time, at our discretion. Once your membership ends, you will lose access to all data, messages, and files stored on the site.
e) You may not assign or transfer your rights or obligations under these Terms without our written consent. Lernitt may assign or transfer its rights or obligations at any time. These Terms apply to both parties and their lawful successors.

7) Enforcement of Our Rights
a) If we don’t enforce a right under these Terms, it doesn’t mean we’ve waived that right. We can still enforce it later.
b) If any part of these Terms is found invalid or unenforceable by a court, the rest will still apply as far as the law allows.

8) Changes to the Website, App or Terms
a) We may update our website, app, content, Terms or fees at any time, without notice.
b) By continuing to use Lernitt after changes are posted, you agree to the new Terms. If you don’t agree, your only option is to stop using our website, app and services.
c) Major changes to the Terms will be clearly dated and published on our website so users can review the latest version.

9) Contacting Customer Support
If you want to report a policy breach, ask a question, or need help, please contact us through the support form on our website.
We aim to respond within a reasonable time but cannot guarantee immediate replies.

10) User Service Agreement
Lernitt may update or modify this Service Agreement at any time. The latest version will always be available on our website. Continued use of our services means you accept any updated version.

11) Fee Collection Service
a) After students choose a tutor, they must pay for the lessons they wish to take. Payment will normally be processed in advance and securely through our platform. Once the lesson is completed, the student will be charged the lesson cost plus a student service fee (our commission). This fee is shown before payment is confirmed.
b) A tutor commission is also taken by Lernitt from the tutor’s fee. This amount is deducted automatically before payment is released to the tutor. The commission rate may vary and will be clearly displayed in the tutor’s account.
c) Tutors are fully responsible for paying all taxes, duties, or other government charges in their own country. Lernitt does not withhold or pay tax on behalf of tutors.

12) Who May Use Our Website and App
a) We may, if allowed by law, and where we have enough information to identify a user, request background or criminal-record checks from official sources. You authorise us to use your personal information, such as your name and date of birth, for this purpose.
b) You confirm that you are at least 18 years old, or have legal parental consent, and that you have the legal capacity to agree to and follow these Terms.
c) If you are under 18, you may only use Lernitt under the active supervision of a parent or legal guardian.
d) Users under the age of 13 are strictly prohibited from creating an account or using any Lernitt service. Minors aged 13–17 may only use the platform with active supervision and consent of a parent or legal guardian.

a) Licence for Use of Our Website and App:
i) If you follow these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive licence to access and use Lernitt solely for finding, booking and conducting lessons.
ii) You must not reverse-engineer, copy, interfere with, or otherwise attempt to modify how the website or app operates, unless permitted by law.
iii) You may not reproduce, sell or exploit any part of Lernitt for any commercial purpose not expressly authorised by us.
b) Our Content and Member Content Licence:
i) If you comply with these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-transferable licence to view Lernitt, tutor and student content for your own personal, non-commercial use.
ii) You may not sublicense, rent, sell or reuse Lernitt’s content or other members’ content outside the platform.
iii) No intellectual-property rights are transferred to you except those expressly allowed here.

14) Tutor and Student Content
a) When you upload content (such as profile information, lesson materials, or videos) you grant Lernitt a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free licence—with the right to sublicense—to use, copy, adapt, display and promote that content on or in connection with Lernitt.
b) You keep ownership of your content but confirm that you have all rights needed to give us this licence.
c) You alone are responsible for anything you post or share. Lernitt is not liable for user-generated material and may remove content that breaches laws or these Terms.

15) Registering for an Account
a) You must register to create a Lernitt account before booking or teaching lessons.
b) Provide only accurate, current and complete information and keep it updated. Each person may hold only one active account.
c) You are responsible for safeguarding your password and any activity that occurs under your account. Notify us immediately if you suspect unauthorised access.

16) Accepting a Student’s Request to Teach
Tutors will receive lesson requests from students. A tutor may accept or decline any request. If no response is given within the request period, the request automatically expires. Once accepted, the tutor must deliver the lesson at the agreed date and time unless both parties agree otherwise.

17) Cancelling Lesson Requests
If a lesson request is cancelled by Lernitt, the tutor or the student for any reason, neither party nor Lernitt is liable for compensation beyond any refund expressly provided under these Terms.

18) Lesson Packages
a) Lesson packages remain valid for six months. After six months of inactivity, any unused balance will be released to the tutor minus Lernitt’s standard commission.
b) If there is a disagreement about who cancelled a package, Lernitt will mediate. Our decision is final.

19) Termination of the Service Agreement
If a lesson agreement exists before termination:
a) Lernitt will still assist both parties in completing existing lessons.
b) Students and tutors must still meet their obligations under that lesson agreement.
c) Lernitt may still collect any service charges due.
d) The agreement takes effect once a student selects a tutor, chooses a program and completes payment.
e) We may preserve limited access to certain features or data for dispute resolution or record-keeping purposes. Termination of this agreement does not void outstanding refund or dispute rights.

20) Disclaimer
We make no guarantees that any tutoring will achieve particular results or that tutor listings are accurate.
Nothing in these Terms limits or excludes your statutory rights under the Australian Consumer Law (Schedule 2 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010).

c) You agree to indemnify Lernitt for any loss or claim arising from your breach of these Terms or misuse of the platform.

a) When downloading through the Apple App Store, you acknowledge that the agreement is between you and Lernitt, not Apple.
