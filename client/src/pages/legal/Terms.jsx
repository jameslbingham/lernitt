      <h2>1) General</h2>
      <p>
        a) By using our website or app, you confirm that you’ve read and understand these
        Terms and Conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        b) Once you complete registration, you become a member and agree to follow these
        Terms and Conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        c) By using our website, app or any of our services, you agree to follow these
        Terms—whether or not you’ve registered an account.
      </p>
      <p>
        d) These Terms form a legal agreement between you and Lernitt covering your use of
        our website, app, services and all related content.
      </p>
      <p>
        e) If you don’t agree with these Terms, please don’t access, register for, or use
        the website, app or services.
      </p>
      <p>
        f) If you break these Terms, we may suspend or close your account. Serious breaches
        could also lead to civil or criminal penalties under the law.
      </p>
      <p>
        g) You understand that Lernitt only provides a platform. We’re not part of any
        agreement between a student and a tutor, and we don’t control how users behave or
        what happens during lessons.
      </p>
      <p>
        h) Tutors use Lernitt as independent contractors, not as employees, partners or
        agents of Lernitt. You’re responsible for your own taxes, insurance, business
        licences and legal obligations in your country.
      </p>
      <p>
        i) Tutors must not claim or suggest that they’re employed by, officially approved
        by, or representing Lernitt, unless we’ve given written permission.
      </p>
      <p>
        j) By using our website or app, you agree to everything in these Terms. If you
        don’t agree, you can’t use Lernitt.
      </p>
      <p>
        k) If you’re using Lernitt on behalf of a company or organisation, you confirm that
        you have the authority to bind it to these Terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        l) Lernitt’s role is limited to providing the online platform and tools that help
        students and tutors connect, schedule lessons and handle payments. We don’t provide
        tutoring ourselves and aren’t responsible for lesson content, timing, quality or
        results.
      </p>
      <p>
        m) These Terms are governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Australia. You agree
        to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Victoria,
        Australia.
      </p>

      <h2>2) Our Service</h2>
      <p>
        a) The main purpose of this website is to provide a platform that helps students
        and tutors find and connect with each other for lessons.
      </p>
      <p>
        b) The goal of this service is to support one-on-one online learning between
        students who want to learn and tutors who wish to teach.
      </p>
      <p>
        c) Students can view tutor profiles, read their descriptions, and choose a tutor
        based on this information. Students decide which tutor they believe best fits their
        learning needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        d) Either a tutor or a student may stop using our website or app at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        e) Lernitt does not guarantee that a student or tutor will find a match, book a
        lesson, or complete a transaction. All users participate at their own risk.
      </p>

      <h2>3) How Our Website, App and Services Work</h2>
      <p>The Site and App provide a space where:</p>
      <p>a) Tutors and students can upload information about their lessons and profiles.</p>
      <p>
        b) Tutors and students can search for, contact, and connect with each other for
        learning purposes.
      </p>
      <p>c) Students can contact tutors directly to arrange lessons.</p>
      <p>
        d) Tutors can advertise their services, respond to messages, and arrange lessons
        directly with students.
      </p>
      <p>
        e) Lernitt only provides the technology platform that allows tutors and students to
        find and contract with each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        f) Lernitt also provides basic tools for communication, scheduling, payment
        processing, and limited dispute assistance. These tools are provided as a
        convenience and do not make Lernitt a party to any agreement between students and
        tutors.
      </p>

      <h2>4) What We Do for Students and Tutors</h2>
      <p>
        a) We make our website and app available so that students and tutors can find and
        connect with each other. We are not involved in their lesson agreements or teaching
        activities. We do not control or guarantee the quality, accuracy, safety, legality,
        or completion of any lesson.
      </p>
      <p>
        b) Once the tutor’s availability, price and service are accepted by both the tutor
        and the student, a “Lesson Contract” is formed between them.
      </p>
      <p>
        c) Lesson Contracts are private agreements between the student and tutor. You must
        not add terms that conflict with these Terms and Conditions or with Australian law.
      </p>
      <p>
        d) Both tutors and students agree to act in good faith and fairness when performing
        their Lesson Contract.
      </p>
      <p>
        e) Lernitt may take actions such as suspending accounts, removing listings, or
        pursuing legal steps if we believe it necessary to protect our users, business, or
        reputation.
      </p>

      <h2>5) General Terms for Tutors and Students</h2>
      <p>
        a) Our Services are available only to individuals or legal entities who can enter
        binding contracts under Australian law. You must accept these Terms before
        registering. Lernitt may, at its discretion, refuse, suspend, or terminate service
        to anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        b) Each tutor and student is responsible for keeping their personal information
        (including email addresses) accurate and up to date. By agreeing to these Terms,
        you release Lernitt from all claims or damages that may arise from inaccurate or
        outdated personal information.
      </p>
      <p>
        c) We may suspend or terminate any tutor or student account for breaching these
        Terms. In such cases, no refunds or compensation will be provided.
      </p>
      <p>
        d) Tutors and students are solely responsible for the accuracy and legality of the
        information they publish on Lernitt, including lesson descriptions, qualifications
        and pricing.
      </p>

      <h2>6) Enforcement of Terms and Conditions</h2>
      <p>
        a) We may suspend or cancel your account if you breach these Terms or act in a way
        that could harm Lernitt or other users.
      </p>
      <p>
        b) Lernitt may suspend or terminate your account if we cannot verify your details,
        if we suspect misconduct, or if your actions may cause legal risk to Lernitt or
        others.
      </p>
      <p>
        c) If your account is suspended or terminated, you must not create or use another
        account. We may also take legal action if necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        d) We may terminate any account at any time, at our discretion. Once your
        membership ends, you will lose access to all data, messages, and files stored on
        the site.
      </p>
      <p>
        e) You may not assign or transfer your rights or obligations under these Terms
        without our written consent. Lernitt may assign or transfer its rights or
        obligations at any time. These Terms apply to both parties and their lawful
        successors.
      </p>

      <h2>7) Enforcement of Our Rights</h2>
      <p>
        a) If we don’t enforce a right under these Terms, it doesn’t mean we’ve waived that
        right. We can still enforce it later.
      </p>
      <p>
        b) If any part of these Terms is found invalid or unenforceable by a court, the
        rest will still apply as far as the law allows.
      </p>

      <h2>8) Changes to the Website, App or Terms</h2>
      <p>
        a) We may update our website, app, content, Terms or fees at any time, without
        notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        b) By continuing to use Lernitt after changes are posted, you agree to the new
        Terms. If you don’t agree, your only option is to stop using our website, app and
        services.
      </p>
      <p>
        c) Major changes to the Terms will be clearly dated and published on our website so
        users can review the latest version.
      </p>

      <h2>9) Contacting Customer Support</h2>
      <p>
        If you want to report a policy breach, ask a question, or need help, please contact
        us through the support form on our website. We aim to respond within a reasonable
        time but cannot guarantee immediate replies.
      </p>

      <h2>10) User Service Agreement</h2>
      <p>
        Lernitt may update or modify this Service Agreement at any time. The latest version
        will always be available on our website. Continued use of our services means you
        accept any updated version.
      </p>

      <h2>11) Fee Collection Service</h2>
      <p>
        a) After students choose a tutor, they must pay for the lessons they wish to take.
        Payment will normally be processed in advance and securely through our platform.
        Once the lesson is completed, the student will be charged the lesson cost plus a
        student service fee (our commission). This fee is shown before payment is
        confirmed.
      </p>
      <p>
        b) A tutor commission is also taken by Lernitt from the tutor’s fee. This amount is
        deducted automatically before payment is released to the tutor. The commission rate
        may vary and will be clearly displayed in the tutor’s account.
      </p>
      <p>
        c) Tutors are fully responsible for paying all taxes, duties, or other government
        charges in their own country. Lernitt does not withhold or pay tax on behalf of
        tutors.
      </p>

      <h2>12) Who May Use Our Website and App</h2>
      <p>
        a) We may, if allowed by law, and where we have enough information to identify a
        user, request background or criminal-record checks from official sources. You
        authorise us to use your personal information, such as your name and date of birth,
        for this purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        b) You confirm that you are at least 18 years old, or have legal parental consent,
        and that you have the legal capacity to agree to and follow these Terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        c) If you are under 18, you may only use Lernitt under the active supervision of a
        parent or legal guardian.
      </p>
      <p>
        d) Users under the age of 13 are strictly prohibited from creating an account or
        using any Lernitt service. Minors aged 13–17 may only use the platform with active
        supervision and consent of a parent or legal guardian.
      </p>

      <h2>13) Our Licence to Tutors and Students</h2>
      <p>a) Licence for Use of Our Website and App:</p>
      <p>
        i) If you follow these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive licence to
        access and use Lernitt solely for finding, booking and conducting lessons.
      </p>
      <p>
        ii) You must not reverse-engineer, copy, interfere with, or otherwise attempt to
        modify how the website or app operates, unless permitted by law.
      </p>
      <p>
        iii) You may not reproduce, sell or exploit any part of Lernitt for any commercial
        purpose not expressly authorised by us.
      </p>
      <p>b) Our Content and Member Content Licence:</p>
      <p>
        i) If you comply with these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-transferable licence
        to view Lernitt, tutor and student content for your own personal, non-commercial
        use.
      </p>
      <p>
        ii) You may not sublicense, rent, sell or reuse Lernitt’s content or other members’
        content outside the platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        iii) No intellectual-property rights are transferred to you except those expressly
        allowed here.
      </p>

      <h2>14) Tutor and Student Content</h2>
      <p>
        a) When you upload content (such as profile information, lesson materials, or
        videos) you grant Lernitt a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free licence—with the
        right to sublicense—to use, copy, adapt, display and promote that content on or in
        connection with Lernitt.
      </p>
      <p>
        b) You keep ownership of your content but confirm that you have all rights needed
        to give us this licence.
      </p>
      <p>
        c) You alone are responsible for anything you post or share. Lernitt is not liable
        for user-generated material and may remove content that breaches laws or these
        Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>15) Registering for an Account</h2>
      <p>
        a) You must register to create a Lernitt account before booking or teaching
        lessons.
      </p>
      <p>
        b) Provide only accurate, current and complete information and keep it updated.
        Each person may hold only one active account.
      </p>
      <p>
        c) You are responsible for safeguarding your password and any activity that occurs
        under your account. Notify us immediately if you suspect unauthorised access.
      </p>

      <h2>16) Accepting a Student’s Request to Teach</h2>
      <p>
        Tutors will receive lesson requests from students. A tutor may accept or decline
        any request. If no response is given within the request period, the request
        automatically expires. Once accepted, the tutor must deliver the lesson at the
        agreed date and time unless both parties agree otherwise.
      </p>

      <h2>17) Cancelling Lesson Requests</h2>
      <p>
        If a lesson request is cancelled by Lernitt, the tutor or the student for any
        reason, neither party nor Lernitt is liable for compensation beyond any refund
        expressly provided under these Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>18) Lesson Packages</h2>
      <p>
        a) Lesson packages remain valid for six months. After six months of inactivity, any
        unused balance will be released to the tutor minus Lernitt’s standard commission.
      </p>
      <p>
        b) If there is a disagreement about who cancelled a package, Lernitt will mediate.
        Our decision is final.
      </p>

      <h2>19) Termination of the Service Agreement</h2>
      <p>If a lesson agreement exists before termination:</p>
      <p>a) Lernitt will still assist both parties in completing existing lessons.</p>
      <p>
        b) Students and tutors must still meet their obligations under that lesson
        agreement.
      </p>
      <p>c) Lernitt may still collect any service charges due.</p>
      <p>
        d) The agreement takes effect once a student selects a tutor, chooses a program and
        completes payment.
      </p>
      <p>
        e) We may preserve limited access to certain features or data for dispute
        resolution or record-keeping purposes. Termination of this agreement does not void
        outstanding refund or dispute rights.
      </p>

      <h2>20) Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        We make no guarantees that any tutoring will achieve particular results or that
        tutor listings are accurate. Nothing in these Terms limits or excludes your
        statutory rights under the Australian Consumer Law (Schedule 2 of the Competition
        and Consumer Act 2010).
      </p>

      <h2>21) Limitations of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        a) Exercise care when communicating online. Lernitt is not responsible for
        verifying the accuracy of user information or lesson content.
      </p>
      <p>
        b) If Lernitt is found legally liable, our total liability will not exceed the
        total lesson fees from your most recent completed lesson agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        c) You agree to indemnify Lernitt for any loss or claim arising from your breach of
        these Terms or misuse of the platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        d) You use all payment services at your own risk. Lernitt and its partners are not
        liable for lost profits, goodwill or data.
      </p>

      <h2>22) Accessing and Downloading from the App Store</h2>
      <p>
        a) When downloading through the Apple App Store, you acknowledge that the agreement
        is between you and Lernitt, not Apple.
      </p>
      <p>b) Apple is not responsible for support or maintenance of the Lernitt app.</p>
      <p>
        c) If an App Store version fails to perform, you may request a refund from Apple;
        beyond that, Apple bears no further responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>d) All other obligations remain Lernitt’s.</p>

      <h2>23) Membership Rules</h2>
      <p>
        a) Once registered and accepted, you become a Student Member or Tutor Member.
      </p>
      <p>
        b) Members must keep data accurate, log in regularly, and comply with all policies.
        Inactivity beyond three months may lead to deletion.
      </p>
      <p>c) Accounts are personal; multiple or shared accounts are prohibited.</p>
      <p>
        d) Members must not tamper with Lernitt’s systems or evaluation tools, nor misuse
        personal data.
      </p>
      <p>e) All members must act honestly and obey local laws.</p>
      <p>f) Tutors must submit CVs, qualification proof and teaching videos upon request.</p>
      <p>
        g) We may refuse or remove any tutor who fails verification or breaches standards,
        while still ensuring payment for completed lessons.
      </p>

      <h2>24) Breach of Obligations</h2>
      <p>
        Lernitt values its reputation and user safety. We may remove any tutor or student
        profile without notice if they breach these Terms, break laws, or endanger the
        integrity of the platform.
      </p>

      <h2>25) Principles of Dispute Settlement</h2>
      <p>
        a) Lernitt provides the platform for lesson agreements but generally does not
        intervene in private disputes.
      </p>
      <p>
